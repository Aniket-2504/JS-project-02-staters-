<h1>Local Time Display</h1>

<p>A simple JavaScript starter project to display the local time.</p>

<br>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This project showcases a basic implementation of JavaScript to retrieve and display the current local time. While it's one of my earlier projects, I've decided to share it on GitHub to provide a starting point for beginners in web development.</P>
<br>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Local Time:</h3><p>Displays the current local time on the webpage.</p>
<h3>JavaScript:</h3><p>Utilizes JavaScript to dynamically update the time.</p>
<br>

<h3>Note</h3>
<p>This is one of my early projects that I never shared before. Feel free to use it as a foundation for learning or building more advanced projects.</p>
